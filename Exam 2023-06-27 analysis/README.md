# Exam 2023-06-27 analysis

This folder contains a presentation of the major bugs and code smells found in the analysis, the SQL scripts employed to retrieve the data from the database SonarQube uses and two Excel files summarizing all gathered data, which were used to perform the statistical analysis - one file containing all the analysed students and the other only the ones who actually received an evaluation for the exam: this second file (_Exam 2023-06-27 only marks_) is the one used for all the different statistical analyses.  
The actual folder containing all analysed projects is not included due to privacy concerns for the students (in the Excel files the students numbers are anonymized).
